##Labor Distribution:
NO LABOR DISTRIBUTION ALL IN TEAMWORK!
STRENGTH IN NUMBERS!


#Progress Report:
We used NetBeans IDE 8.0.2
Libraries imported: MySQL JDBC Driver (this is used for the calling the database system features of XAMPP)
XAMMP is the control panel for the database.
For the username and password design, you have 3 buttons which are create account, login, and exit.
If you create account you will be directed in this page, then it will be saved in the database. If you want to check it, just run xampp, start the apache and MySQL then click the admin of MySQL and you will be redirected in a webpage.
